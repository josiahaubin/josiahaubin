      Greetings, my name is Josiah Aubin. I am a software developer who loves
      all
      things coding.
      <br />I developed a love for coding after my first coding class in college. After a few more
      classes
      that required coding and getting lost in it for hours on end, I realized that a career as a developer
      was for
      me. After graduation, I attended Boise CodeWorks to futher my coding skill and to gain the knowledge needed to perform at my
      best
      in the industry.
    </p>

      If I am not spending my time behind a computer writing lines of code you can find
      me:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-left list-unstyled mx-4">
      <li class="py-1">
        Completing main missions (after all the side missions of course), capturing objectives,
        holding control
        points, or pushing payloads in some of my favorite videogames.
      </li>
      <li class="py-1">Spending time outdoors camping, fishing, and hunting.</li>
      <li class="py-1">Getting excerise by lifting weights or playing basketball.</li>
      <li class="py-1">Laughing with friends, or enjoying time with my family.</li>
    </ul>
